    subduction_count(Dᴳᵢ, Dᴴⱼ[, αβγᴴⱼ]) --> Int

For two groups ``G`` and ``H``, where ``H`` is a subgroup of ``G``, i.e. ``H<G``, with
associated irreducible representations `Dᴳᵢ` = ``D^G_i(g)`` and `Dᴴⱼ` = ``D^H_j(g)`` over
operations ``g∈G`` and ``h∈H<G``, compute the compatibility relation between the two irreps
from the subduction reduction formula (or "magic" formula/Schur orthogonality relation),
returning how many times ``n^{GH}_{ij}`` the subduced representation ``D^G_i↓H`` contains 
the irrep ``D^H_j``; in other words, this gives the compatibility between the two irreps.

Optionally, a vector `αβγᴴⱼ` may be provided, to evaluate the characters/irreps 
of `Dᴳᵢ` at a concrete value of ``(α,β,γ)``. This is e.g. meaningful for `LGIrrep`s at
non-special **k**-vectors. Defaults to `nothing`.

The result is computed using the reduction formula [see e.g. Eq. (15) of
[arXiv:1706.09272v2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.09272)]:

``n^{GH}_{ij} = |H|^{-1} \sum_h \chi^G_i(h)\chi^H_j(h)^*``

## Example
Consider the two compatible **k**-vectors Γ (a point) and Σ (a line) in space group 207:
```jl
lgirsd  = lgirreps(207, Val(3));
Γ_lgirs = lgirsd["Γ"]; # at Γ ≡ [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
Σ_lgirs = lgirsd["Σ"]; # at Σ ≡ [α, α, 0.0]
```
We can test their compatibility via:
```jl
[[subduction_count(Γi, Σj) for Γi in Γ_lgirs] for Σj in Σ_lgirs]
> # Γ₁ Γ₂ Γ₃ Γ₄ Γ₅
>  [ 1, 0, 1, 1, 2] # Σ₁
>  [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 1] # Σ₂
```
With following enterpretatation for compatibility relations between irreps at Γ and Σ:

| Compatibility relation | Degeneracies |
|------------------------|--------------|
| Γ₁ → Σ₁                | 1 → 1        |
| Γ₂ → Σ₂                | 1 → 1        |
| Γ₃ → Σ₁ + Σ₂           | 2 → 1 + 1    |
| Γ₄ → Σ₁ + 2Σ₂          | 3 → 1 + 2    |
| Γ₅ → 2Σ₁ + Σ₂          | 3 → 2 + 1    |

where, in this case, all the small irreps are one-dimensional.
