From `lgirs`, a vector of `LGIrrep`s, determine the associated (gray) co-representations,
i.e. the "real", or "physical" irreps that are relevant in scenarios with time-reversal
symmetry.

For `LGIrrep` that are `REAL`, or that characterize a k-point 𝐤 which is not
equivalent to -𝐤 (i.e. its star does not include both 𝐤 and -𝐤; equivalently, the little
group includes time-reversal symmetry), the associated co-representations are just the 
original irreps themselves. 
For `PSEUDOREAL` and `COMPLEX` `LGIrrep`s where ±𝐤 are equivalent, the
associated co-representations are built from pairs of irreps that "stick" together. This
method computes this pairing and sets the `LGIrrep` field `iscorep` to true, to indicate
that the resulting "paired irrep" (i.e. the co-representation) should be doubled with 
itself (`PSEUDOREAL` reality) or its complex conjugate (`COMPLEX` reality).

For double-valued irreps (`DLGIrrep`s), time reversal squares to -1 and the roles of `REAL`
and `PSEUDOREAL` are interchanged: `REAL` irreps are doubled with themselves, while
`PSEUDOREAL` irreps are unchanged.

### Background
For background, see p. 650-652 (and p. 622-626 for point groups) in Bradley & Cracknell's
book. Their discussion is for magnetic groups (the "realified" irreps are, in fact, simply
co-representations of the "gray" magnetic groups). 
Cornwell's book also explicates this at some length as does Inui et al. (p. 296-299).

### Keyword arguments
- `verbose::Bool`: if set to `true`, prints details about mapping from small irrep to small
corep for each `LGIrrep` (default: `false`).

        αβγ::Union{Vector{<:Real},Nothing} = nothing
    ) --> ::(Enum Reality)

Compute and return the reality of a `lgir::AbstractLGIrrep` using the Herring criterion.

The computed value is one of three integers in ``{1,-1,0}``.
In practice, this value is returned via a member of the Enum `Reality`, which has instances
`REAL = 1`, `PSEUDOREAL = -1`, and `COMPLEX = 0`.

## Optional arguments
As a sanity check, a value of `αβγ` can be provided to check for invariance along a symmetry
symmetry line/plane/general point in k-space. The reality must be invariant to this choice.

## Note 
The provided space group operations `sgops` **must** be the set reduced by primitive
translation vectors; i.e. using `spacegroup(...)` directly is **not** allowable in general
(since the irreps we reference only include these "reduced" operations). This reduced set
of operations can be obtained e.g. from the Γ point irreps of ISOTROPY's dataset, or
alternatively, from `reduce_ops(spacegroup(...), true)`.

For a double-valued irrep (a `DLGIrrep`), `sgops` must be the operations of the double
space group, likewise reduced (e.g., the operations of its little group at Γ).

## Implementation
The Herring criterion evaluates the following sum

``[M(k)/g_0] ∑ χ({β|b}²)``

over symmetry operations ``{β|b}`` that take ``k → -k``. Here ``g_0`` is the order of the
point group of the space group and ``M(k)`` is the order of star(``k``) [both in a primitive
basis]. Their ratio is the order of the little co-group, i.e. the number of operations of
the little group of `lgir` (which includes no centering copies). For a double group, the
sum and the ratio both double, and the criterion is otherwise unchanged.

See e.g. Cornwell, p. 150-152 & 187-188 (which we mainly followed), Inui Eq. (13.48), 
Dresselhaus, p. 618, or [Herring's original paper](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.52.361).

    $(TYPEDSIGNATURES)

Return a multiplicative factor for use in checking the orthogonality relations of
"physically real" irreps (coreps).

For such "physically real" irreps, the conventional orthogonality relations (by conventional
we mean orthogonality relations that sum only over unitary operations, i.e. no "gray"
operations/products with time-inversion) still hold if we include a multiplicative factor
`f` that depends on the underlying reality type `r` of the corep, such that `f(REAL) = 1`,
`f(COMPLEX) = 2`, and `f(PSEUDOREAL) = 4`. For double-valued irreps, the roles of `REAL` and
`PSEUDOREAL` are interchanged.
If the provided irrep is not a corep (i.e. has `iscorep(ir) = false`), the multiplicative
factor is 1.
