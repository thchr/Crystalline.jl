    levelsetlattice(sgnum::Integer, D::Integer=2, idxmax::NTuple=ntuple(i->2,D))
        --> UnityFourierLattice{D}

Compute a "neutral"/uninitialized Fourier lattice basis, a UnityFourierLattice, consistent
with the symmetries of the space group `sgnum` in dimension `D`. The resulting lattice
`flat` is expanded in a Fourier basis split into symmetry-derived orbits, with intra-orbit 
coefficients constrained by the symmetries of the space-group. The inter-orbit coefficients
are, however, free and unconstrained.

The Fourier resolution along each reciprocal lattice vector is controlled by `idxmax`:
e.g., if `D = 2` and `idxmax = (2, 3)`, the resulting Fourier lattice may contain 
reciprocal lattice vectors (k‚ÇÅ, k‚ÇÇ) with k‚ÇÅ‚àà[0,¬±1,¬±2] and k‚ÇÇ‚àà[0,¬±1,¬±2,¬±3], referred 
to a ùêÜ-basis.

This "neutral" lattice can, and usually should, be subsequently modulated by `modulate`
(modulates the inter-orbit coefficients, which will often eliminate symmetries that may
remain in the "neutral" configuration, where all inter-orbit coefficients are unity).

# Examples

Compute a UnityFourierLattice, modulate it with random inter-orbit coefficients via `modulate`,
and finally plot it (requires `using PyPlot`):

Derive a concrete, modulated Fourier lattice from `flat`, a UnityFourierLattice 
struct (that contains the _interrelations_ between orbit coefficients), by 
multiplying the "normalized" orbit coefficients by a `modulation`, a _complex_
modulating vector (in general, should be complex; otherwise restores unintended
symmetry to the lattice). Distinct `modulation` vectors produce distinct 
realizations of the same lattice described by the original `flat`. By default,
a random complex vector is used.

An exponent `expon` can be provided, which introduces a penalty term to short-
wavelength features (i.e. high-|G| orbits) by dividing the orbit coefficients
by |G|^`expon`; producing a more "localized" and "smooth" lattice boundary
when `expon > 0` (reverse for `expon < 0`). This basically amounts to a 
continuous "simplifying" operation on the lattice (it is not necessarily a 
smoothing operation; it simply suppresses "high-frequency" components).
