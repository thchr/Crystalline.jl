        --> UnityFourierLattice{D}

Compute a "neutral"/uninitialized Fourier lattice basis, a UnityFourierLattice, consistent
with the symmetries of the space group `sgnum` in dimension `D`. The resulting lattice
`flat` is expanded in a Fourier basis split into symmetry-derived orbits, with intra-orbit 
coefficients constrained by the symmetries of the space-group. The inter-orbit coefficients
are, however, free and unconstrained.

The Fourier resolution along each reciprocal lattice vector is controlled by `idxmax`:
e.g., if `D = 2` and `idxmax = (2, 3)`, the resulting Fourier lattice may contain 
reciprocal lattice vectors (k₁, k₂) with k₁∈[0,±1,±2] and k₂∈[0,±1,±2,±3], referred 
to a 𝐆-basis.

This "neutral" lattice can, and usually should, be subsequently modulated by `modulate`
(modulates the inter-orbit coefficients, which will often eliminate symmetries that may
remain in the "neutral" configuration, where all inter-orbit coefficients are unity).

# Examples

Compute a UnityFourierLattice, modulate it with random inter-orbit coefficients via `modulate`,
and finally plot it (requires `using PyPlot`):

Given `flat` referred to a conventional basis with centering `cntr`, compute the

Specifically, if `flat` refers to a direct conventional basis Rs≡(𝐚 𝐛 𝐜) [with

basis Rs′≡(𝐚′ 𝐛′ 𝐜′)≡(𝐚 𝐛 𝐜)P [with coordinate-vectors 𝐫′≡(r₁′, r₂′, r₃′)ᵀ=P⁻¹𝐫],
where P denotes the basis-change matrix obtained from `primitivebasismatrix(...)`.

Derive a concrete, modulated Fourier lattice from `flat`, a UnityFourierLattice 
struct (that contains the _interrelations_ between orbit coefficients), by 
multiplying the "normalized" orbit coefficients by a `modulation`, a _complex_
modulating vector (in general, should be complex; otherwise restores unintended
symmetry to the lattice). Distinct `modulation` vectors produce distinct 
realizations of the same lattice described by the original `flat`. By default,
a random complex vector is used.

An exponent `expon` can be provided, which introduces a penalty term to short-
wavelength features (i.e. high-|G| orbits) by dividing the orbit coefficients
by |G|^`expon`; producing a more "localized" and "smooth" lattice boundary
when `expon > 0` (reverse for `expon < 0`). This basically amounts to a 
continuous "simplifying" operation on the lattice (it is not necessarily a 
smoothing operation; it simply suppresses "high-frequency" components).
If `expon = nothing`, no rescaling is performed. 

The `normscale(!)` methods exists to perform subsequent `expon` norm-rescaling 
of a `ModulatedFourierLattice`.
