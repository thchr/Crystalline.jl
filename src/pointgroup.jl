Return the (crystallographic) point group irreps of the IUC label `iuclab` of dimension `D`

See `Crystalline.PG_IUC2NUM[D]` for possible IUC labels in dimension `D`.

## Notation

The irrep labelling follows the conventions of CDML [^1] [which occasionally differ from
those in e.g. Bradley and Cracknell, *The Mathematical Theory of Symmetry in Solids* 
(1972)].

To use Mulliken ("spectroscopist") irrep labels instead, set the keyword argument
`mulliken = true` (default, `false`). See also [`mulliken`](@ref).

    find_isomorphic_parent_pointgroup(g::AbstractVector{SymOperation{D}}) 
                                                    --> PointGroup{D}, Vector{Int}, Bool

Given a group `g` (or a collection of operators, defining a group), identifies a "parent"
point group that is isomorphic to `g`.

Three variables are returned:
- `pg`: the identified "parent" point group, with operators sorted to match the sorting
  of `g`'s operators.
- `Iᵖ²ᵍ`: a permutation vector which transforms the standard sorting of point group
  operations (as returned by [`pointgroup(::String)`](@ref)) to the operator sorting of `g`.
- `equal`: a boolean, identifying whether the point group parts of `g` operations are
  identical (`true`) or merely isomorphic to the point group operations in `g`.
  In practice, this indicates whether `pg` and `g` are in the same setting or not.

## Implementation
The identification is made partly on the basis of comparison of operators (this is is
sufficient for the `equal = true` case) and partly on the basis of comparison of 
multiplication tables (`equal = false` case); the latter can be combinatorially slow if
the sorting of operators is unlucky (i.e., if permutation between sortings in `g` and `pg`
differ by many pairwise permutations).

Beyond mere isomorphisms of multiplication tables, the search also guarantees that all
rotation orders are shared between `pg` and `g`; similarly, the rotation senses (e.g., 4⁺ &
4⁻ have opposite rotation senses or directions) are shared. This disambiguates point groups 
that are intrinsically isomorphic to eachother, e.g. "m" and "-1", but which still differ in
their spatial interpretation.

## Properties
The following properties hold for `g`, `pg`, and `Iᵖ²ᵍ`:
```jl
pg, Iᵖ²ᵍ, equal = find_isomorphic_parent_pointgroup(g)
@assert MultTable(pg) == MultTable(pointgroup(g))
pg′ = pointgroup(label(pg), dim(pg)) # "standard" sorting
@assert pg′[Iᵖ²ᵍ] == pg
```
If `equal = true`, the following also holds:
```jl
pointgroup(g) == operations(pg) == operations(pg′)[Iᵖ²ᵍ]
```

## Example
```jl
sgnum = 141
wp    = wyckoffs(sgnum, Val(3))[end] # 4a Wyckoff position
sg    = spacegroup(sgnum, Val(3))
siteg = sitegroup(sg, wp)

    $TYPEDSIGNATURES --> Matrix{Int}

Returns a multiplication table derived from `mt` but under a reordering permutation `P` of
the operator indices in `mt`. In practice, this corresponds to a permutation of the rows
and columns of `mt` as well as a subsequent relabelling of elements via `P`.

## Example
```jl
pg  = pointgroup("-4m2", Val(3))
mt  = MultTable(pg)
P   = [2,3,1,4,5,8,6,7] # permutation of operator indices
mt′ = permute_multtable(mt.table, P)
mt′ == MultTable(pg[P]).table
```
