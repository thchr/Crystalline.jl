Return the conjugacy classes of a group ``G`` defined by symmetry operations `ops`.

## Definitions
Two elements ``a`` and ``b`` in ``G`` are considered conjugate if there exists a ``g ∈ G``
such that ``gag^{-1} = b``. This defines an equivalence relation ``\\sim``, i.e., we say
that ``a \\sim b`` if ``a`` and ``b`` are conjugate.
The conjugacy classes of ``G`` are the distinct equivalence classes that can be identified
under this equivalence relation, i.e. the grouping of ``G`` into subsets that are equivalent
under conjugacy.

## Extended help
If `ops` describe operations in a crystal system that is not primitive (i.e., if its
[`centering`](@ref) type is not `p` or `P`) but is presented in a conventional setting,
the centering symbol `cntr` _must_ be given. If `ops` is not in a centered crystal
system, or if `ops` is already reduced to a primitive setting, `cntr` should be given as
`nothing` (default behavior) or, alternatively, as `P` or `p` (depending on dimensionality).

A single-argument calls to `classes` with `SpaceGroup` or `LittleGroup` types will
assume that `ops` is provided in a conventional setting, i.e., will forward the method call
to `classes(ops, centering(ops, dim(ops)))`. To avoid this behavior (if `ops` was already
reduced to a primitive setting prior to calling `classes`), `cntr` should be provided
explicitly as `nothing`.
