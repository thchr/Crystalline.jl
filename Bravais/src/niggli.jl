    nigglibasis(Rs; rtol=1e-5, max_iterations=200)

Given a set of primitive basis vectors `Rs`, return a basis `Rs′` for the corresponding
Niggli-reduced unit cell, as well as a transformation matrix `P`, such that
`Rs′ = transform(Rs, P)` (see [`transform`](@ref)).

## Definition

A Niggli-reduced basis ``(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c})`` represents a unique
choice of basis for any given lattice (or, more precisely, a unique choice of the basis
vector lengths ``|\\mathbf{a}|, |\\mathbf{b}|, |\\mathbf{c}|``, and mutual angles between 
``\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{c}``). This uniqueness is one of the main motivations
for computing the Niggli reduction procedure, as it enables easy comparison of lattices.
Additionally, the associated Niggli-reduced basis vectors ``(\\mathbf{a}, \\mathbf{b},
\\mathbf{c})``, fulfil several conditions [^3]:

1. **"Main" conditions:**
    - The basis vectors are sorted by increasing length:
      ``|\\mathbf{a}| ≤ |\\mathbf{b}| ≤ |\\mathbf{c}|``.
    - The angles between basis vectors are either all acute or all non-acute.
2. **"Special" conditions:**
    - Several special conditions, applied in "special" cases, such as
      ``|\\mathbf{a}| = |\\mathbf{b}|`` or 
      `\\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{c} = \\tfrac{1}{2}|\\mathbf{b}|^2`. See Ref. [^3] for
      details.

Equivalently, the Niggli-reduced basis fulfils the following geometric conditions (Section
9.3.1 of Ref. [^3]):
- The basis vectors are sorted by increasing length.
- The basis vectors have least possible total length, i.e., ``|\\mathbf{a}| + |\\mathbf{b}|
  + |\\mathbf{c}|`` is minimum. I.e., the associated Niggli cell is a Buerger cell.
- The associated Buerger cell has maximum deviation among all other Buerger cells, i.e., the
  basis vector angles ``α, β, γ`` maximize ``|90° - α| + |90° - β| + |90° - γ|``.
  
## Keyword arguments

- `rtol :: Real`: relative tolerance used in the Grosse-Kunstleve approach for floating point
  comparisons (default: `1e-5`).
- `max_iterations :: Int`: maximum number of iterations in which to cycle the Krivy-Gruber
  steps (default: `200`).

## Implementation

Implementation follows the algorithm originally described by Krivy & Gruber [^1], with the
stability modificiations proposed by Grosse-Kunstleve et al. [^2] (without which the 
algorithm proposed in [^1] simply does not work on floating point hardware).
