## 2ⁿᵈ orthogonality theorem (characters) [automatically includes 1ˢᵗ orthog. theorem also]:

# for irreps Dᵢ⁽ᵃ⁾ and Dᵢ⁽ᵝ⁾ in the same little group (with i running over the 
# Nₒₚ = Nₒₚ⁽ᵃ⁾ = Nₒₚ⁽ᵝ⁾ elements).
# Because we are dealing with coreps here, the orthogonality relations are modified
# somewhat. Assuming that we still only sum over the unitary operations (i.e. no gray 
# operations, i.e. products with time-inversion), we should include a multiplicative factor
# `f` in the orthogonality relations, as in Bradley & Cracknell Eq. 7.4.10. `f` equals:
#       real => 1; pseudoreal => 4; complex => 2
# see `corep_orthogonality_factor(lgir)` above.

# TODO: Great orthogonality theorem of coreps:
#       It's not immediately obvious how to do this properly. E.g., if we just try:
#
#               ∑ᵢ[Dᵢ⁽ᵃ⁾]ₙₘ*[Dᵢ⁽ᵝ⁾]ⱼₖ = δₐᵦδₙⱼδₘₖNₒₚ⁽ᵃ⁾/dim(D⁽ᵃ⁾)
#
#       with the sum only running over the unitary elements, then we run into trouble when
#       (nm) and (jk) are referencing different blocks in the block diagonal form of the 
#       "realified" matrices. Of course, when they reference the same blocks, everything is
#       fine, since it's then just as if we had never "realified" them in the first place.
#       Introducing a multiplicative factor `f` as in the character orthogonality theorem
#       also isn't helpful here.
#       The issue probably is that we really do need to use the entire gray group here, i.e.
#       include the antiunitary elements in the i-sum. That's more bothersome, and we don't
#       have a use for the irreps of the antiunitary elements otherwise, so it doesn't seem
#       worthwhile...
